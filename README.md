# ScrapeAway
A Solo Developed Web Scraper To Find Price Updates On Various Computer Parts

Because this project essentially undergoes dramatic changes week by week, I have chosen to avoid a full-bown readme so as not to have to update it with new pictures weekly.

The purpose of this project is to find and pull data from a website, currently just Newegg, about various computer componets.
CPUs, GPUs, PSUs, RAM, Motherboards. Some of these don't yet exist, but will be added.
The plan is to then have the program refresh, rescrape the data and update me about price changes.
Additionally I would like to add a text/email-alert on dramatic price drops on products that have had changes in price.
